## Version 2.0.0 â€“ Usability & Hardware Improvements

### Updates & Fixes

- **Replaced IR Remote with Buttons:**  
  The unreliable IR remote has been removed. Its core features are now accessible via physical buttons, offering improved consistency and reliability.

- **Added Potentiometer for LCD Brightness:**  
  A potentiometer has been added to allow manual adjustment of the LCD screen brightness. This makes the display readable in all lighting conditions.

- **Repositioned LCD Display:**  
  The LCD has been relocated to the bottom of the device, no longer hanging over the edge. This improves the stability and usability of the device on any flat surface.

- **Integrated Power Supply Module:**  
  A hardware power switch has been added to easily turn the device on or off without unplugging it.

### Known Issues

- **Button Accessibility:**  
  Physical buttons are currently positioned in a way that may be hard to reach during use. Future revisions will address layout ergonomics.

- **Limited Sensor Mobility:**  
  The ultrasonic sensor can only be rotated and is difficult to reposition vertically or horizontally. A redesigned mount is under consideration.
