## Version 2.0.0 â€“ Usability & Hardware Improvements

### Updates & Enhancements

- **Reworked Wiring & Hardware Layout**  
  The hardware was fully rewired and reorganized to accommodate the removal of the IR receiver. New components, including physical buttons and a passive buzzer, were integrated into a cleaner and more reliable configuration.

- **Replaced IR Remote with Physical Buttons**  
  The previously unreliable IR remote has been removed. All key functions are now controlled using physical buttons, improving responsiveness and reliability.

- **Added Passive Buzzer for Audible Alerts**  
  A passive buzzer has been introduced to play jingles at specific time intervals, providing audio feedback without disrupting the timer logic.

- **LCD Brightness Control via Potentiometer**  
  A potentiometer has been added to allow dynamic adjustment of the LCD backlight brightness. This ensures readability in various lighting conditions.

- **LCD Display Repositioned for Stability**  
  The screen has been moved to the base of the unit to eliminate overhang. This allows the timer to rest flat and securely on any surface.

- **Integrated Power Supply Switch**  
  A dedicated power supply module with an on/off switch has been added, making it easier to power the device without unplugging it.

### Known Issues

- **Difficult-to-Reach Buttons**  
  The current button placement may be awkward for some users. Future revisions will focus on improving accessibility and ergonomics.

- **Limited Sensor Adjustability**  
  The ultrasonic sensor can only rotate on a single axis, making fine-tuning its direction difficult. A new adjustable mounting design is under consideration.
