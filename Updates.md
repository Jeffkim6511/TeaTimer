## Version 1.0.0 â€“ Initial Release

### Known Issues

- **IR Remote Limitations:**  
  The IR remote control is unreliable and inconsistent in this setup. Replacing the IR interface with physical buttons is recommended for improved user experience and stability.

- **LCD Visibility Problems:**  
  The 16x2 LCD is difficult to read in bright daylight. Switching to a **7-segment digit display** or other high-contrast display options is advised for better readability.

- **Mounting Challenges:**  
  The current design requires the LCD to hang below the main enclosure. This forces the box to sit partially off a ledge, causing balance issues. A **counterweight** was added to prevent tipping. Using a smaller or more integrated display may eliminate the need for external support.

- **No Power Toggle:**  
  A dedicated power switch is missing. Future versions should integrate a **power supply module** with an on/off toggle to simplify operation and reduce power consumption when not in use.
